A simple python program that generates an mp3 of an AI voice using [elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io).

Make sure to create a `key.txt` file in the same directory as the PyaiiTTS executable and paste in your elevenlabs API key!
Note that PyaiiTTS will create files such as `conf.json`, `pref.json`, `themes.json`, & `voices.json` in the directory that the executable is placed in!
